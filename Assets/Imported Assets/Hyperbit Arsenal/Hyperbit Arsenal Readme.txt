"Standard Assets" - This folder includes a refraction shader if you wish to use the DistortionShockwave prefabs which are an extra effect for

F.A.Q.:

Q: I think this pack is missing something / This pack doesn't have an effect like this!

-

Q: My projectile effect isn't working properly!

A: Some of the projectile effects only emit particles when they are moving, so you will have to put it in motion to get the full effect.

-

Q: My impact effects rotation is odd! 
A: Some of the impact effects default rotation is set to impact at a floor. This means you will have to script the impact effect to be rotated according to the surface direction.

Q: Can you help me with coding?
